how to add global css styles
I prefere to create css file and import it

--- only way to see css is run npm run build and have a look into dist->assets files(first one)

you can also use multiple css files e.g like reset.css ....How he used it? using @import './reset.css'; at the top of styles.css file.


-- if you want to use sass, you need to install sass .
